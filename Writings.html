    <h2>Mental Well-Being Informative Essay</h2>
    <p> 
        <br><br>
        Your emotions are a combination of events and how you interpret them. Mental health can create a problem and help your body at the same time. There is a mental issue that increases our hormones and neurotransmitters which gives energy to our muscles, provokes heart attacks, and increases our blood pressure. Feeling angry is a result of your brain perceiving a physical or emotional threat. It is always helpful to know the problems anger can cause, its facts, and solutions to help cope with it.
        <br><br>
        It is essential to know how to identify anger and what problems it can cause. Your brain functions in a way that it sees anger as a threat to self-protection which makes it challenging to handle yourself at times. For example, when a person experiences anger, the brain informs the body to release stress hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. According to ThriveUnion, “Too much anger compromises our brains, creates high blood pressure, heart disease, and compromised immune systems” (How The Brain Works, 00:01:22 – 00:01:26). The longer we hold onto anger, the more our relationships are in danger of getting destroyed. Psychologists can help control anger. According to the American Psychological Association, “Several large analyses of the published research suggests that overall, approximately 75% of people receiving anger management therapy improved as a result (Understanding Anger, 2020). This shows that therapists can help control your anger. Given these points, it is clear to see that anger can become a serious problem if it is left uncontrolled.
        <br><br>
        Since anger affects everyone in different ways, it is crucial to know facts about it. If there is uncontrolled anger, it can lead to disastrous problems such as headaches and depression. For example, when a person experiences anger, they think it is good because shouting at your children can make them do their chores or make your co-workers do things your way. According to the American Psychological Association, “Anger can increase your blood pressure, give higher chances of heart attacks and spoil your relationships with family members, friends, and co-workers” (Understanding Anger, 2020). Often, you feel angry if you have PTSD, depression, or alcohol problems. There is a process that creates anger in your body. According to Megan Saxelby, “You experience an event. Your brain processes and sends signals to your brain’s limbic system. When that happens our brain sends distress signals. Your brain sends chemicals to the rest of your body telling it to protect you” (Understanding Anger, 2020). This shows that anger can be controlled if you recognize the symptoms. To sum up, it is clear to see that anger, just like any other disease has cures.
        <br><br>
        Even though we all experience anger, it is vital to know solutions to help cope with it. Scientists have found many solutions to help calm anger. For example, when a person experiences anger, the brain gets a signal that you are getting physical or emotional threats close to your body. According to Megan Saxelby, “If you feel safe, tell the person exactly what you didn’t like and what you want instead. Own up to anything that you contributed to the problem. Be ready to listen to another side of the story. Affirm your boundaries and respect the other person’s perspective and personal boundaries” (Understanding Anger, 2020). When you start to become angry, your heart beats faster and you start breathing harder. Some of the ways to control anger are counting backward from ten, slowing down the breathing, and exercising regularly. According to ThriveUnion, “Research shows that meditation has been shown to both shrink the amygdala and grow the prefrontal cortexes” (How The Brain Works, 00:01:43 – 00:01:49). This shows that anger can be controlled by meditation. Overall, it is clear to see that anger has many solutions.

        Although there are many variations of mental health problems, there are a few that are spoken of. Some of these problems such as anger are eye-catching to me because of their effectiveness and their uniqueness. Anger is required to understand not only because it can create a problem, but also because there are many unknown facts on this subject. The endmost reason anger is elemental is because we need to know solutions to help cope with it.

    <h2>Children Need To Struggle To Become More Independent</h2>
    <p> 
        <br><br>
        Children need to struggle to become more independent. Are you willing to let your children be more independent at the cost of allowing them to strive? Back when I was in my primary years, I used to have no friends and got bullied at school every day. Somehow, when I look back at those moments, I feel glad that I came out of this stronger. This entire experience has molded me into becoming a self-sufficient teenager. Today I would like to share with you my experience and hopefully, it will give some courage to at least one person here today who is being bullied and is finding it difficult to overcome it.
        <br><br>
        As I mentioned earlier, I was a victim of bullying for a very long time. However, I do not look at this as a negative thing. This incident has allowed me to stand up for myself and speak up against these bullies. Whenever this happened, I usually ignored the threat or told a teacher. Over a few rough years, I understood that speaking up to an adult will only worsen the bullying. The only option I had left was to allow myself to succumb to them. However, that day was different. I finally spoke up. I fought back. What I did was that I went directly to the bullies and ordered them to back off. The following day, when I came back to school, I didn't get threats but surprisingly made numerous friends.
        <br><br>
        Wherever you go, you are always going to encounter bullies. Although, I believe there are many ways to escape. I like to think of it as a baby using a walker. Let me give you an example. When a baby initially starts to walk, he sits on the walker so that he doesn’t fall. But if his parents let him use the walker for the rest of his life, he will never be able to learn how to properly walk. There has to be a time where parents watch the baby walk and fall by himself. Just like that, parents, guardians, or trusted adults cannot always help children fight back. Children need to learn to make mistakes and fail. Your child has to learn how to pull themselves out of a situation because as they reach high school or college, they might not have you there to show the bullies where they actually belong.
        <br><br>
        Overall, I think children should have to struggle with their lives to become efficient. Parents need to be willing to see their loved ones suffer, even if it's just to make them more independent. Can I give you the responsibility to make your child more mature?
